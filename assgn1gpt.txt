i wana do a assignment for my dsbda lab
in which i have to add dataset to my jupyter notebook through four different ways 
1. donwload as zip from kaggle
2. import directly in notebook
3. create your own dataset 
4. use mysql and something with the dataset i duno remember
ChatGPT said:
Alright. Here’s a clean, lab-ready breakdown of your DSBDA assignment. This is exactly what your evaluator expects—clear methods, basic operations, and proof you understand data ingestion.

Dataset Setup in Jupyter Notebook (4 Ways)
We’ll use Python + Pandas throughout.

1️⃣ Download Dataset as ZIP from Kaggle
What this shows: You can work with external datasets.

Steps
Go to kaggle.com → Dataset → Download (ZIP)

Extract the ZIP file

Place the CSV inside your project folder

Load it in Jupyter

Code
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("dataset_name.csv")
df.head()
👉 Mention dataset name and source in your assignment (very important).

2️⃣ Import Dataset Directly in Notebook (URL-based)
What this shows: You can load online datasets programmatically.

Example (CSV hosted online)
import pandas as pd

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
df.head()
✔ No download
✔ No manual file handling
✔ Clean and professional approach

3️⃣ Create Your Own Dataset
What this shows: You understand data structure and attributes.

Example: Student Dataset
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Student_ID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Name": ["Amit", "Riya", "Suresh", "Neha", "Rahul"],
    "Marks": [78, 85, 69, 90, 72],
    "Attendance": [92, 88, 75, 95, 80]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df
You can also save it:

df.to_csv("student_data.csv", index=False)
4️⃣ Use MySQL Database with Dataset
This is the part most students mess up. Do it right.

Step 1: Create Table in MySQL
CREATE DATABASE dsbda;
USE dsbda;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Aman', 'IT', 60000),
(2, 'Pooja', 'HR', 45000),
(3, 'Ravi', 'Finance', 50000);
Step 2: Connect MySQL to Jupyter
Install connector:

pip install mysql-connector-python
Python Code
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="your_password",
    database="dsbda"
)

query = "SELECT * FROM employees"
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
df
✔ This counts as dataset loading
✔ Shows database + analytics integration

Optional (But Smart): Perform Basic Operations
Add this to score extra points:

df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()
df['salary'].mean()
How to Write This in Your Assignment
Use this structure:

Conclusion

If you want, I can:

Pick one common dataset and apply all 4 methods

Format this into a proper lab record

Add data preprocessing + visualization (bar chart, histogram, etc.)

Just say the word.

You said:
the way i opened jupyter notebook....is through i got into anaconda3 and then in bin then opened anaconda navigator through terminal
ChatGPT said:
That’s perfectly fine—and it’s technically correct. You just need to document it cleanly in your lab record. No drama.

Here’s how you should write it.

How Jupyter Notebook Was Opened (Using Anaconda Navigator)
Method Description
Jupyter Notebook was launched using Anaconda Navigator, which was accessed through the terminal from the Anaconda3 installation directory.

Steps Followed
Opened Terminal

Navigated to the Anaconda bin directory:

cd anaconda3/bin
Launched Anaconda Navigator using:

./anaconda-navigator
From Anaconda Navigator, selected and launched Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook opened in the default web browser

Why This Method Is Valid
Anaconda Navigator manages Python environments cleanly

Ensures all required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) are pre-installed

Recommended for data science workflows

Industry-standard approach

One-Line Version (If Your Teacher Wants It Short)
Jupyter Notebook was launched via Anaconda Navigator, which was opened through the terminal by navigating to the Anaconda3 bin directory.

Pro Tip (Use This If Asked in Viva)
Anaconda Navigator provides a GUI-based interface to manage environments and launch tools like Jupyter Notebook, ensuring dependency consistency.

If you want, I can:

Merge this directly into your DSBDA lab assignment

Rewrite it in exam-oriented language

Help you add screenshots + captions to make it bulletproof

Tell me what you need next.

You said:
so where tf is my this jupyter notebook saved
ChatGPT said:
Short answer: wherever you launched it from.
Long answer below—no fluff.

Where Your Jupyter Notebook Is Actually Saved
Default behavior
Jupyter Notebook opens in a working directory.
That directory is the root folder shown in the Jupyter file browser when it opens in your browser.

➡️ That folder = where your .ipynb files are saved.

In your case (Anaconda Navigator via terminal)
You:

Opened terminal

Ran Anaconda Navigator

Launched Jupyter from Navigator

👉 Navigator decides the start directory, not the bin folder.

Most common locations (Linux)
Check these first:

/home/your_username/
or

/home/your_username/Documents/
Your notebook file will look like:

something.ipynb
The Fastest Way to Find It (No Guessing)
Inside Jupyter Notebook
Open the notebook

In a cell, run:

import os
os.getcwd()
💥 That path printed is exactly where your notebook lives.

From Terminal (Also Bulletproof)
If Jupyter is still running:

jupyter notebook list
It will show:

http://localhost:8888/?token=...
    :: /home/your_username
That path at the end is your notebook directory.

If You Can See the Notebook in Browser but Not on Disk
You’re just looking in the wrong folder.
Use File → Open in Jupyter → note the folder path at the top.

Best Practice (Do This Once)
Create a dedicated lab folder:

mkdir ~/DSBDA_Lab
Then start Jupyter inside it:

cd ~/DSBDA_Lab
jupyter notebook
Now everything is clean, organized, and submission-ready.

Bottom line
Your notebook is not in anaconda3/bin.
It’s in the Jupyter working directory, almost certainly your home folder.

If you want, tell me:

OS (Linux / Windows / macOS)

Whether you launched Jupyter from Navigator or terminal today

I’ll pinpoint the exact path—no hunting around.

now i know where my notebook is ......now how to do my assignment
ChatGPT said:
Good. Now stop overthinking it and execute.
Below is a straight, lab-ready workflow. Follow it top-to-bottom and your assignment is done.

DSBDA Lab Assignment
Topic: Loading Dataset in Jupyter Notebook Using Multiple Methods

0️⃣ Create One Clean Notebook
In your Jupyter working folder:

New → Python 3 Notebook

Rename it to:

DSBDA_Dataset_Loading.ipynb
Add this at the top (Markdown cell):

## Aim
To load and analyze datasets in Jupyter Notebook using four different methods.
1️⃣ Method 1: Download Dataset from Kaggle (ZIP)
Markdown (Explain)
### Method 1: Dataset Loaded from Kaggle (ZIP Download)
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle in ZIP format, extracted, and loaded using Pandas.
Code Cell
import pandas as pd

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")   # use your actual filename
df_kaggle.head()
Optional (looks good in exams):

df_kaggle.shape
df_kaggle.describe()
2️⃣ Method 2: Import Dataset Directly Using URL
Markdown
### Method 2: Dataset Loaded Directly Using URL
The dataset was imported directly into the notebook using an online CSV file.
Code
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"
df_url = pd.read_csv(url)
df_url.head()
3️⃣ Method 3: Create Your Own Dataset
Markdown
### Method 3: Manually Created Dataset
A custom dataset was created using Python dictionaries and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
Code
data = {
    "Student_ID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Name": ["Amit", "Riya", "Suresh", "Neha", "Rahul"],
    "Marks": [78, 85, 69, 90, 72],
    "Attendance": [92, 88, 75, 95, 80]
}

df_custom = pd.DataFrame(data)
df_custom
Save it (optional but smart):

df_custom.to_csv("student_data.csv", index=False)
4️⃣ Method 4: Load Dataset from MySQL Database
Markdown
### Method 4: Dataset Loaded from MySQL Database
A dataset stored in a MySQL database was connected and imported into Jupyter Notebook.
Code
import mysql.connector

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="your_password",
    database="dsbda"
)

query = "SELECT * FROM employees"
df_mysql = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
df_mysql
Basic operation:

df_mysql['salary'].mean()
5️⃣ Conclusion (Markdown Cell)
## Conclusion
Datasets were successfully loaded into Jupyter Notebook using four different techniques:
1. Kaggle ZIP download
2. Direct URL import
3. Manual dataset creation
4. MySQL database connection

This demonstrates flexibility in data acquisition methods for data analysis tasks.
What Your Teacher Will Check (and You Now Pass)
✅ Jupyter used correctly
✅ Multiple dataset sources
✅ Pandas usage
✅ Database integration
✅ Proper documentation

Final Pro Tips (Don’t Skip)
Restart kernel → Run all cells once

Take screenshots of output

Submit .ipynb + dataset files if asked

If you want, I can:

Clean this into perfect lab-record language

Add graphs (bar chart, histogram)

Make it viva-proof with Q&A

Say what you want next and we finish it.

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'archive.csv'
ChatGPT said:
Good — this error is exactly what should happen if the file isn’t where Python is looking. No mystery here. Let’s fix it properly.

Why You’re Getting FileNotFoundError
pd.read_csv("archive.csv")
Python is saying:

“I looked in the current working directory and that file is not there.”

So one of these is true:

The file name is not actually archive.csv

The file is in a different folder

The ZIP was not extracted

You’re assuming Kaggle named it archive.csv (it usually doesn’t)

Step 1: Confirm Your Working Directory (Do This First)
Run this in a new cell:

import os
os.getcwd()
👉 That path is where Jupyter is searching for archive.csv.

Step 2: See What Files Are Actually There
os.listdir()
Look carefully:

Is archive.csv listed?

Or do you see a folder like archive/ or kaggle_dataset/?

Or a different CSV name?

⚠️ Kaggle almost never names the file archive.csv.
That’s usually the ZIP name.

Step 3: Fix Based on What You See
Case 1: File name is different
Example:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")
Case 2: CSV is inside a folder
Example:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("archive/heart.csv")
Case 3: ZIP not extracted
Extract it first:

unzip archive.zip
(or extract manually)

Then load the CSV inside.

Step 4: Bulletproof Way (Absolute Path)
If you want zero errors:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("/home/your_username/DSBDA_Lab/heart.csv")
Absolute paths never lie.

What to Write in Your Assignment (Important)
Correct explanation:

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle in ZIP format, extracted locally, and the CSV file was loaded into Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas read_csv() function.

❌ Do not mention errors in the record.

Sanity Check (Run This After Loading)
df_kaggle.head()
df_kaggle.shape
df_kaggle.columns
If these work, Method 1 is done.

Bottom Line
archive.csv ≠ your dataset

Python only reads files that exist in the working directory

os.listdir() tells the truth

If you want, paste the output of:

os.listdir()
and I’ll tell you exactly what filename to use.

You said:
'/home/csl-4'
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. That tells us everything.

Your current working directory is:

/home/csl-4
So archive.csv is NOT in this folder. End of story.

Now do this step by step and it will work.

Step 1: Put the Kaggle CSV in the RIGHT Folder
You have two clean options. Pick one.

✅ Option A (Recommended – cleanest)
Move the extracted Kaggle CSV into:

/home/csl-4
You can do this:

Using file manager (drag & drop)
OR

Using terminal:

mv ~/Downloads/heart.csv /home/csl-4/
(Replace heart.csv with the real filename.)

✅ Option B (Use Subfolder – also valid)
If your file is in:

/home/csl-4/kaggle_data/heart.csv
Then load it like this:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("kaggle_data/heart.csv")
Relative paths matter. Python is literal.

Step 2: Verify Before Loading (No Guessing)
Run:

import os
os.listdir("/home/csl-4")
You must see the CSV filename in the output.

Step 3: Load the Dataset (Correct Way)
Example:

import pandas as pd

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")
df_kaggle.head()
If this works → Method 1 is done.

Step 4: Lock It In (Optional but Smart)
Create a dataset folder:

mkdir /home/csl-4/datasets
mv heart.csv /home/csl-4/datasets/
Then:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("datasets/heart.csv")
Looks professional. Evaluators like this.

What NOT to Do
❌ Don’t guess filenames
❌ Don’t assume ZIP name = CSV name
❌ Don’t keep files in Downloads and hope Python finds them

Bottom Line
Jupyter looks only inside /home/csl-4 unless you tell it otherwise.
Put the CSV there or give the correct path.

If you want, paste:

os.listdir("/home/csl-4")
and I’ll tell you exactly which filename to use—no trial and error.

You said:
(base) csl-4@csl4-HP-280-G3-MT:~$ ls
anaconda3     Documents		 examples.desktop  Music      seaborn-data
archive.zip   Downloads		 Main-Projects	   nltk_data  snap
assgn1.ipynb  eclipse		 mongo_backup_3_6  Pictures   Templates
Desktop       eclipse-workspace  mongodb-crud-app  Public     Videos
(base) csl-4@csl4-HP-280-G3-MT:~$ cd home
bash: cd: home: No such file or directory
ChatGPT said:
Good, this output clears everything up. Here’s the no-nonsense fix.

What Your ls Output Tells Us
You are already in:

/home/csl-4
That ~ is /home/csl-4.
So this command:

cd home
failed because there is no folder named home inside /home/csl-4.
You were trying to go into the place you’re already in.

The Real Problem (Method 1)
You have:

archive.zip
But NO CSV file yet.

So when you wrote:

pd.read_csv("archive.csv")
Python said “no such file” — correctly.

Fix Method 1 Properly (Do This Now)
Step 1: Extract the ZIP
From terminal (you’re already in the right place):

unzip archive.zip
Now run:

ls
You should see:

a .csv file
OR

a new folder containing .csv

Step 2: Locate the Actual CSV
If you see a CSV directly:

heart.csv
then in Jupyter:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")
If you see a folder (example):

archive/
then:

ls archive
and load like:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("archive/heart.csv")
Absolute-Safe Version (Never Fails)
df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("/home/csl-4/archive/heart.csv")
(Replace filename if different.)

What to Write in Your Lab Record (Important)
Correct wording:

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle in ZIP format, extracted in the home directory, and the CSV file was loaded into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.

❌ Do NOT mention command errors
❌ Do NOT mention trial-and-error

Sanity Check (Must Work)
df_kaggle.head()
df_kaggle.shape
If this runs → Method 1 is officially complete.

One Final Tip (Cleaner Submission)
Create a datasets folder:

mkdir datasets
mv archive/* datasets/
Then:

df_kaggle = pd.read_csv("datasets/heart.csv")
Clean. Professional. Examiner-proof.

Run unzip archive.zip, then ls, and tell me exactly what CSV filename appears. I’ll give you the precise read_csv() line to paste and move on to Method 2.

You said:
method 1 is done let's move to method 2
ChatGPT said:
Good. Don’t touch Method 1 again.
We move cleanly to Method 2.

Method 2: Import Dataset Directly in Jupyter Notebook (No Download)
Goal: Load a dataset directly from the internet using a URL.

This proves you can ingest remote data programmatically.

Step 1: Add a Markdown Cell (Write This)
### Method 2: Dataset Loaded Directly Using URL

In this method, a dataset was imported directly into the Jupyter Notebook from an online source using its URL and the Pandas library.
Step 2: Add a Code Cell (Paste Exactly)
We’ll use a stable, public dataset. No surprises.

import pandas as pd

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"

df_url = pd.read_csv(url)
df_url.head()
You should immediately see the Iris dataset.

Step 3: Minimal Analysis (Do This – Examiners Expect It)
df_url.shape
df_url.columns
df_url.describe()
Optional but clean:

df_url.isnull().sum()
Step 4: (Optional) Save It Locally
This makes your notebook reproducible.

df_url.to_csv("iris_from_url.csv", index=False)
What to Write in the Lab Record (Exact Language)
The dataset was loaded directly into the Jupyter Notebook from an online CSV file using its URL with the Pandas read_csv() function, without downloading the file manually.

That’s it. No extra explanation needed.

Quick Validation Checklist
✅ No ZIP file
✅ No local file path
✅ Loaded via URL
✅ Data visible with head()

If all true → Method 2 is complete.

When you’re ready, say “Method 3” and we’ll finish the custom dataset part in under 5 minutes.

You said:
yes mehtod 3 now
ChatGPT said:
Good. Method 3 is straightforward and quick. Do it cleanly and move on.

Method 3: Create Your Own Dataset
Goal: Show you understand how datasets are structured and can create one manually.

Step 1: Add a Markdown Cell (Write This)
### Method 3: Manually Created Dataset

In this method, a custom dataset was created manually using Python data structures and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
Step 2: Add a Code Cell (Paste This)
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Student_ID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Name": ["Amit", "Riya", "Suresh", "Neha", "Rahul"],
    "Marks": [78, 85, 69, 90, 72],
    "Attendance": [92, 88, 75, 95, 80]
}

df_custom = pd.DataFrame(data)
df_custom
You should see a clean table. If you don’t, stop and fix it before moving on.

Step 3: Basic Operations (Mandatory for Marks)
df_custom.shape
df_custom.describe()
Optional but good:

df_custom.isnull().sum()
Step 4: Save the Dataset (Strongly Recommended)
df_custom.to_csv("student_data.csv", index=False)
This proves persistence and data handling.

What to Write in the Lab Record (Exact Text)
A dataset was manually created using Python dictionaries and converted into a Pandas DataFrame using the Pandas library.

No extra stories. Keep it professional.

Validation Checklist
✅ Dataset created manually
✅ Converted to DataFrame
✅ Displayed in notebook
✅ Saved as CSV

If all true → Method 3 is complete.

Say “Method 4” when you’re ready. That’s the last one, and it involves MySQL.

You said:
done...now mehtod4
ChatGPT said:
Alright. This is the final and most important method. Do it once, do it right.

Method 4: Load Dataset from MySQL Database

    password="YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD",
    database="dsbda"
)

query = "SELECT * FROM employees"
df_mysql = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
df_mysql
If you see the table → you’re good.

6️⃣ Perform One Operation (Mandatory)
df_mysql.shape
df_mysql['salary'].mean()
Optional:

df_mysql.groupby("department")["salary"].mean()
What to Write in the Lab Record (Exact Text)
The dataset was retrieved from a MySQL database by establishing a database connection in Jupyter Notebook and executing SQL queries using Python.

Final Checklist (Must Be True)

You said:
okay now let's get back to method 4
ChatGPT said:
Alright. Back to Method 4 (MySQL ↔ Jupyter).
I’ll assume one of two things is happening: either you want to redo it cleanly, or you want to extend it so it looks solid for submission. I’ll cover both—briefly.

Method 4 — Clean, Final Version (What You Should Have)
1️⃣ MySQL: Verify Database + Table
Open MySQL and confirm things exist. No assumptions.

mysql -u root -p
SHOW DATABASES;
USE dsbda;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM employees;
If this works, move on. If not, stop and fix MySQL first.

2️⃣ Jupyter: Load Data from MySQL (Core Requirement)
This is the minimum code your examiner expects.

import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="YOUR_PASSWORD",
    database="dsbda"
)

query = "SELECT * FROM employees"
df_mysql = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

df_mysql
If the table prints → connection is correct.

3️⃣ Mandatory Operations on MySQL Dataset
Do at least 2. These prove analysis, not just loading.

df_mysql.shape
df_mysql.describe()
df_mysql['salary'].mean()
Optional but strong:

df_mysql.groupby('department')['salary'].mean()
4️⃣ (Very Smart) Write Back to MySQL
This elevates your assignment.

df_mysql['bonus'] = df_mysql['salary'] * 0.10
df_mysql
Save back to MySQL:

df_mysql.to_sql(
    name='employees_bonus',
    con=conn,
    if_exists='replace',
    index=False
)
Now verify in MySQL:

SELECT * FROM employees_bonus;
What to Write in the Lab Record (Final, Polished)
Use this exact wording:

A dataset stored in a MySQL database was accessed by establishing a database connection in Jupyter Notebook. SQL queries were executed to retrieve the data into a Pandas DataFrame, and basic analytical operations were performed.

That’s examiner-proof.

Common Mistakes (Avoid These)
❌ Forgetting to start MySQL service
❌ Wrong database name
❌ Not showing any operation after loading
❌ Hardcoding errors in screenshots

Final Checklist for Method 4
✅ MySQL table exists
✅ Connected from Jupyter
✅ Data visible as DataFrame
✅ At least one aggregation performed

If all boxes checked → Method 4 is complete and strong.

Viva questions specifically from Method 4

Help fixing any MySQL error message

Say what you want and we close this cleanly.

You said:
iam not able to access mysql from normal terminal
ChatGPT said:
Alright. Let’s be blunt and fix this properly.
If you can’t access MySQL from a normal terminal, it’s almost always one of these issues: MySQL not installed, service not running, or wrong command/user.

We’ll diagnose in order. Don’t skip steps.

Step 1: Check if MySQL Is Installed
Run this in terminal:

mysql --version
Outcomes
✅ Version shown → MySQL is installed → go to Step 2

❌ command not found → MySQL is not installed → jump to Step 5

Step 2: Check if MySQL Service Is Running (Linux)
sudo systemctl status mysql
Outcomes
✅ active (running) → go to Step 3

❌ inactive / dead / not found → start it:

sudo systemctl start mysql
Then recheck:

sudo systemctl status mysql
Step 3: Try Logging In Correctly
Use this exact command:

mysql -u root -p
⚠️ Notes:

Do not type the password visibly

Press Enter after -p, then enter password

If this works → MySQL access is fixed
If it fails → read the error carefully
Step 4: Common Errors & Direct Fixes
❌ Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
Root password issue.

Fix:

sudo mysql
Then inside MySQL:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'newpassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Now try again:

mysql -u root -p
❌ Can't connect to local MySQL server
Service is not running.

Fix:

sudo systemctl start mysql
❌ mysql: command not found
MySQL not installed or PATH issue → Step 5.

Step 5: Install MySQL (If Not Installed)
On Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
Start it:

sudo systemctl start mysql
Secure it:

sudo mysql_secure_installation
Then login:

mysql -u root -p
Step 6: Absolute Fallback (Guaranteed Access)
If nothing works:

sudo mysql
This logs you in without password (local root access).

Once inside:

SHOW DATABASES;
After This (Important for Method 4)
Once MySQL opens successfully, immediately do:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dsbda;
USE dsbda;
This confirms MySQL is usable for your assignment.

Bottom Line
You are blocked before Jupyter.
Until mysql -u root -p works in terminal, Method 4 cannot work.

Now tell me exactly what error you see when you run:
mysql -u root -p
Paste the error message. I’ll give you the precise fix—no guessing.

You said:
(base) csl-4@csl4-HP-280-G3-MT:~$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 
ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
ChatGPT said:
Good — this error is clear and fixable.
You’re hitting the default Ubuntu MySQL auth issue. Nothing’s broken.

What ERROR 1698 Means (Straight Truth)
MySQL is installed and running, but:

root is authenticated via unix_socket

NOT via password

So mysql -u root -p is expected to fail

This is normal on Ubuntu/Linux.

Correct Way to Access MySQL (Right Now)
✅ Use this (it WILL work):
sudo mysql
That logs you in as MySQL root using system permissions.

Once inside, verify:

SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
If that works → MySQL access is solved.

Now Fix It Properly (So Jupyter Can Connect)
Jupyter cannot use sudo mysql, so we must switch root to password auth
OR create a new MySQL user (cleaner, recommended).

✅ OPTION 1 (Recommended): Create a New MySQL User for Jupyter
Inside MySQL (sudo mysql):

CREATE USER 'dsbda_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dsbda123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dsbda_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Test from terminal:

mysql -u dsbda_user -p
If this works → use this user in Jupyter.

Jupyter Code (Correct Credentials)
import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="dsbda_user",
    password="dsbda123",
    database="dsbda"
)

df_mysql = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM employees", conn)
df_mysql
This is the cleanest, examiner-safe solution.

❌ OPTION 2 (Not Recommended, But Works): Change Root Auth
Only do this if your lab insists on root.

Inside MySQL:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
BY 'newpassword';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Then:

mysql -u root -p
⚠️ This is less secure. Use only if required.

What to Write in Your Lab Record (Safe Language)
A MySQL user was configured and authenticated to establish a secure database connection between MySQL and Jupyter Notebook.

No mention of errors. Ever.

Bottom Line
❌ Your MySQL is NOT broken

❌ You did nothing wrong

✅ Ubuntu uses socket auth by default

✅ Creating a separate DB user is the correct fix

Do this next (in order):
Run sudo mysql

Create dsbda_user

Test login

Update Jupyter connection

If you hit any error in those steps, paste it. We’ll finish Method 4 cleanly.

ProgrammingError: 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'dsbda'
ChatGPT said:
Good — this error is actually progress.
Connection worked, authentication worked. Now MySQL is saying:

Database dsbda does not exist

That’s it. Nothing else is wrong.

Why This Happened (Straight Truth)
You created dsbda_user

You tried to connect to database dsbda

But dsbda was never created (or was created under a different user/session)

MySQL won’t auto-create databases on connect.

Fix (2 Minutes, Guaranteed)
Step 1: Log in to MySQL (This WILL work)
sudo mysql
Step 2: Create the Database
Inside MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE dsbda;
Verify:

SHOW DATABASES;
You must see dsbda listed.

Step 3: Give Your User Access (Important)
Still inside MySQL:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dsbda.* TO 'dsbda_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Step 4: Create Table + Insert Data
Now log in as your user:

mysql -u dsbda_user -p
Then:

USE dsbda;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Aman', 'IT', 60000),
(2, 'Pooja', 'HR', 45000),
(3, 'Ravi', 'Finance', 50000),
(4, 'Neha', 'IT', 65000);

SELECT * FROM employees;
EXIT;
If SELECT works → database is ready.

Step 5: Go Back to Jupyter (Final Time)
Run exactly this:

import mysql.connector
import pandas as pd

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="dsbda_user",
    password="dsbda123",
    database="dsbda"
)

df_mysql = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM employees", conn)
df_mysql
You should now see the table in Jupyter. No errors.

What to Write in Your Lab Record (Clean & Safe)
A MySQL database was created and accessed using a dedicated database user. The data was retrieved into Jupyter Notebook by establishing a database connection and executing SQL queries.

Bottom Line
❌ Authentication is NOT the issue

❌ Connector is NOT broken

✅ Database simply didn’t exist

✅ This is a standard MySQL workflow step

Do Steps 1–4 now.
If any command throws an error, paste it exactly. We’ll finish Method 4 and close this assignment cleanly.
